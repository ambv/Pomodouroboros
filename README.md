# Pomodouroboros

Most pomodoro trackers assume you're going to start them. But time and tide
wait for no one - the great pomodoro of the cosmos is cold and dark, and it
goes on forever.

For people with ADHD or other executive function disorders, time blindness is
common; the inability to notice that time is passing or initiate tasks at an
appropriate time.  It's easy to let half the day slip by before starting your
first pomodoro.

Pomodouroboros's goal is to:

1. stay constantly in your visual field so that you will ABSOLUTELY not forget
   to set some goals
2. remind you that death stalks your every step, and the pomodoros are
   happening whether you're making use of them or not
